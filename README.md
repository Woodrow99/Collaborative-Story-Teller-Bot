# Collaborative Story-Teller Bot
Recurrent neural networks are interesting structure of neural networks that apply themselves in unique ways for text generation as described by Andrej Karpathy's blog: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ . The following repository consists of a toy example attempting to create an interactive story-teller bot through the usage of keras and tensorflow. The current model is trained on a variety of classical literature ranging from Dracula to War of the Worlds.
