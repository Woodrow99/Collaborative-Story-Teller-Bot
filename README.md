## Description
Recurrent neural networks are interesting structure of neural networks that apply themselves in unique ways for text generation as described by Andrej Karpathy's blog: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ . The following repository consists of a toy example attempting to create an interactive story-teller bot through the usage of python-3, keras, and tensorflow. The current model is trained on a variety of classical literature ranging from *Dracula* to *War of the Worlds*, and it allows for the user and the system to make stories through a variety of prompts.
